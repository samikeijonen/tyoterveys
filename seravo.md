### Credentials for vagrant

WordPress:
```
user:     vagrant
password: vagrant
```

MariaDB (MySQL):
```
user:     root
password: root
```

## Development

The layout of this repo is designed in a way which allows you to open source your site without exposing any confidential data. By default all sensitive data is ignored by git.

All plugins are handled by composer so they are ignored by git. If you create custom plugins, force add them to git so that they are tracked or add new lines into .gitignore to not ignore.

Example of not ignore line in .gitignore: ```!htdocs/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/```

If you create custom themes, they are automatically tracked in git.

Best way to develop custom plugins and themes is to add them into their own repositories and install them by composer.
You can do this by adding ```composer.json``` for your plugin/theme and then requiring them in your project like:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/your-name/custom-plugin.git"
  }
],
"require": {
    "your-name/custom-plugin": "*"
}
```

## Updates
Vagrant will let you know as soon as a new version of the Vagrant box is available. You may download the newest box via `$ vagrant box update`

To update your vagrant to use the new image run:
```
$ vagrant box update
$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant up
```

## Configuration

### config.yml
Change `name` in config.yml to change your site name. This is used in quite some places in development environment.

Add `production => domain` and `production => ssh_port` to sync with your production instance.

Add new domains under `development => domains` before first vagrant up to have extra domains.

See `config-sample.yml` for more

## The Layout

The root of this repository equals the contents of the directory ```/data/wordpress``` in the Seravo.com instance.

## WordPress plugins

The composer.json contains some plugins and themes that are likely to be useful for pretty much every installation. For particular use cases see our list of recommended plugins at http://wp-palvelu.fi/lisaosat/

Note that all plugins are installed, but not active by default. To activate them, run `vagrant ssh -c "wp plugin activate --all"`.
